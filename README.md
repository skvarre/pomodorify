## About

Pomodorify is a react web application that integrates the pomodoro technique with the Spotify Web Playback SDK. The timer syncs with the Spotify music and notifies the user when to focus on tasks and when to take breaks.

This project was built with React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. API calls to the Web Playback SDK is done client-side, however authorization is handled with a simple backend found in `/api`.
